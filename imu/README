IMU is 3 devices on i2c (/dev/i2c-1):

address map:
0x68: ITG3200 3-axis gyro
0x1e: HMC5883L 3-axis compass
0x53: ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer

ITG3200 gyro:
16 DLPF_FS -> set to 0x18 + 0..6,
  0=256Hz bw / 8kHz samplerate,
 ... all 1kHz after this
  1=188Hz bw / 1kHz samplerate,
  2=98Hz bw  / 1kHz samplerate,
  5=10Hz,
  6=5Hz bw
1D GYRO_XOUT_H
1E GYRO_XOUT_L
1F GYRO_YOUT_H
20 GYRO_YOUT_L
21 GYRO_ZOUT_H
22 GYRO_ZOUT_L
no fifo, but an interrupt pin.  hmm.  not sure if there's any way to tell if
there's new data without using the interrupt pin, but a 1kHz samplerate is
really fast; we'll have to set the bandwidth and assume our own samplerate

ADXL345 accelerometer:
0x2c - bw_rate - defaults to 0x0a, 100Hz, 50Hz bandwidth
 0x07 - 12.5Hz samplerate, 6.25Hz bw
 0x08 - 25Hz samplerate, 12.5Hz bw
0x2d - power_ctl - need to enable measure bit to turn on; set to 0x08
0x31 â€” DATA_FORMAT - 0x08 - set FULL_RES
32 X-Axis data 0
33 X-Axis data 1
...
37 Z-Axis data 1

this chip has a FIFO; how to use it?

HMC5883L compass:
0x00 - CRA - controls output rate and number of averaged samples
0x01 - CRB - upper 3 bits control gain, 0xe0 least gain, 0x00 most, 0x20 default
 -- need to do some sort of AGC here to try to figure out compass direction, though local magnetic fields might just throw it off completely, especially from our motor
0x02 - mode register - 0x00 for continuous measurement
0x03:04 - x (towards pins 5-8) msb:lsb
0x05:06 - z (up) msb:lsb
0x07:08 - y (towards pins 9-12) msb:lsb
0x09 - status - bit 0 set if new data
